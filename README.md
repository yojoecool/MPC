# MPC
iOS Final Project

This was a simple MPC app. There are 16 buttons on the screen like an MPC, with each button corresponding to a different percussion sound (i.e. snare drums, bass drums, etc.). When the user presses a button, a sound will play. Multiple buttons can be pressed simultaneously as well. There is also a metronome that can be used to play along with. While it defaults at 90 BPM, the user can input a different tempo if they choose to.
